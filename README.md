## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tesseract OCR engine
- Required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Packages
```txt name=requirements.txt
PyQt6
opencv-python
numpy
pytesseract
Pillow
pyenchant
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/Ritinikhil/OCR-Engine.git
cd OCR-Engine
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Tesseract OCR:
   - **Windows**: Download and install from [Tesseract GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`

4. Configure Tesseract path in the code:
```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'  # Adjust path as needed
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Using the Application:
   - Click "Select Image" to choose an image file
   - Configure OCR settings:
     - OCR Engine Mode (Legacy/LSTM/Combined)
     - Page Segmentation Mode
     - Preprocessing options (Denoising, Deskewing)
     - Thresholding Method
     - Post-processing options (Spell Check)
   - Click "Process Image" to start OCR
   - View results in the text area

## Features in Detail

### OCR Engine Options
- **Legacy Engine**: Traditional Tesseract engine
- **LSTM Engine**: Neural network-based engine
- **Combined Mode**: Uses both engines for better accuracy

### Preprocessing Options
- **Denoising**: Reduces image noise
- **Deskewing**: Corrects image orientation
- **Thresholding Methods**: 
  - Adaptive: Better for varying lighting conditions
  - Otsu: Optimal for clear, binary images

### Post-processing Features
- Spell checking with PyEnchant
- Confidence scoring
- Timestamp logging
- Formatted output with metadata

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Image loading validation
- Memory usage monitoring
- Process tracking
- Detailed error logging

## Logging

The application maintains detailed logs in `ocr_app.log`, including:
- Process completion status
- Error messages
- Confidence scores
- Timestamps
